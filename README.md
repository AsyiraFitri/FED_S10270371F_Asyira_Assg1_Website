## Design Process
### Understanding the Brand and Goals
   The goal was to create a seamless, visually appealing shopping experience focused on comfort, style, and customer service. I aligned the website's design with these core values.

### User Research and Target Audience
    I dedicated time to researching the target audience --- people looking for    comfortable yet stylish apparel. I considered their preferences, browsing habits, and expectations to ensure the website’s design would resonate with them and offer a user-friendly experience.

### Wireframing and Prototyping
    Once I had a clear understanding of the brand and audience, I started wireframing the website. This allowed me to visualize the layout and how users would interact with pages like product listings, the checkout process, and payment options. After wireframing, I created a prototype to test basic interactions and gather feedback before proceeding with the full design.

### Visual Design and Branding
    I focused on clean, modern visuals that match the brand’s identity. I selected appropriate colors, typography, and graphics while ensuring a strong visual hierarchy for easy navigation.

### Responsive Design
    I made the website fully responsive to provide a consistent experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
